        <p class="para">One of my favourite hobbies is Reading. Reading helps us in many ways, like it increases our vocabulary, our imagination and even reduces our stress!. The genres I love to read are fantasy, adventurous, mysterious, crime and horror. The importance of a reading habit is that it strengthens mental muscles. I am a student of 5th grade whenever I return from school, after resting and before going to play I daily read stories for 10 - 30 minutes. I also have a reading companion which I made myself . I nedd to write the book name , date, for how much time I read the book, main charecters etc. I sometimes even try to write stories myself. Reading and books are your friends.
